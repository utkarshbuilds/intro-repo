# My First GitHub Project
Hi there! I'm Utkarsh Raj an 18-year-old recent 12th graduate with science stream.
I'm passionate about exploring the world of technology and its endless
possibilities.

My skills estend beyond academics. I possess a keen eye for detail and efficency, demontrated
by my typing speed of 45 WPM with 99% accuracy. I'm also actively developing my creative side 
throungh video and content creation, creating engaging short videos for my YouTube channel with 19k+ views on one of my videos.
Futhermore, I'm proficient in Microsoft Excel, Word, Powerpoint.

The world of coding truly fascinates me. I've embarked on my coding journey by learning HTML and
CSS, and currently taking CS50 (Introduction to computer science) course.
I'm excited to delve deeper into the realm of software development. I'm a quick learner, driven 
by curosity, and eager to contribute my skills and passion to innovative projects.

I'm actively seeking opportunities to learn and grow in the field of Computer Science.
Let's connect and explore the potential of technology together!
